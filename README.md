# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
This project is a simple web application vulnerability scanner designed to detect common web security issues like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in web forms. It features a web-based interface that allows users to input a URL, scan the target web application, and generate a detailed PDF report of the findings.

## Features
- **Web Interface**: Users can interact with the scanner through a user-friendly web interface built with Flask.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: The scanner checks for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and XSS.
- **PDF Reporting**: Generates a detailed PDF report of the scan results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Requests
- fpdf

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
    cd web-vulnerability-scanner
    ```

2. **Install the Required Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Start the Target Server**: If you are testing with a local server, you can use the provided `target_server.py` as a simple example.
    ```bash
    python target_server.py
    ```

2. **Run the Web Interface**:
    ```bash
    python web_interface.py
    ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Scan a URL**: 
    - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
    - Enter the URL you want to scan (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000` if using the local target server).
    - Click "Submit" to start the scan.

4. **View and Download the Report**:
    - After the scan, the results will be displayed on the web page.
    - You can download the PDF report by clicking the "Download the Report" link.
